A friend ask me if he could see my [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) setup.

> Well sure just look at my repositories

But than i noticed that it's private for no reason - so here we go!

**tl;dr**

Maybe there are some things you like to know or wanna see:

* All script or style changes are compiled and committed locally
* [data files](https://github.com/minddust/minddust.github.io/blob/master/_data) workaround to filter by [category](https://github.com/minddust/minddust.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/blog_by_category.html) and by [tag](https://github.com/minddust/minddust.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/blog_by_tag.html) (*cause GitHub’s jekyll setup doesn’t allow you to use plugins*)
* [post layout](https://github.com/minddust/minddust.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/post.html) usage of data information
